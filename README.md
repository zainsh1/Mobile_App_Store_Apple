## As part of this Analysis & Cleaning - Trying to answer a few questions

### 1) What app genres are most popular?

### 2) Paid Apps or Free Apps worth the investment, which is better, why?

### 3) How can I maximize user ratings?

### 4) Is it worth the time investment to support multiple languages? what's the best amount of lanuages if any

### 5) Is there any correlation between longer descriptions and user ratings? if so, why?

# Final Recommendations 

Paid apps versus Free Apps - After analysis we found that paid apps have higher average ratings, could be a number of reasons.
Users who pay for an app have higher engagement and perceived value leading to higher ratings, if the app is valued, you could charge an appropriate amount.

Apps that support multiple languages are more beneficial as it reaches a more wide audience. Analyis has shown that apps that have languages between 10-30 have the best average ratings.
So the quantity of languages isn't vital but rather focus on the app product itself.

The Finance & Book apps have lowest average ratings and this might suggest that user needs are not being fully met and this can represent a market opportunity. If you're able to create a quality app.
It can strive and address the concerns users have towards this genre.

We also found that having a longer description of length has a positive correlation with average ratings, likely appreciate having a clear understanding of what exactly services & features the app will provide.
Before they download & pay for an app, creating a clear expectation of the purpose. On average, apps have an average rating of 3.5 so a developer should aim for client average ratings at least > 3.5/5 for a successful product.

Lastly, analysis has shown that the 'Games' & 'Entertainment' genres have the highest competition especially games with over 3.5k apps and 2nd highest being Entertainment at 535 apps. 
As suggested, both of these markets have the most amount of apps and represent a saturated market thus entering into this space can be challenging but simultaneously suggesting a higher user demand in this genre.
